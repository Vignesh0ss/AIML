    <p>Tourism & Heritage
One of the oldest living cities, Madurai, holds the soul of Tamil Nadu in its magnificent and grand temples that are among the finest and most awe-inspiring specimens of architecture in the country. The most spectacular of these is the Meenakshi-Sundareswarar Temple, which is the heartbeat of the city and is visited by thousands of devotees. Madurai once traded with ancient Rome and it preserves its distinct character in various arts and textiles that have been bestowed by the Pandian kings (4th century-16th century). From exquisite sarees to wooden toys and sculptures, Madurai is a hub of shopping, where visitors can find a fine selection of unique and handmade products. After a busy and vibrant sample of the city's bustling streets, tourists can take a respite in the serene and scenic hill stations flanking the city. From the picturesque hill station of Kodaikanal to splendid waterfalls, Madurai is surrounded by natural beauty that leaves you breathless.</P>
